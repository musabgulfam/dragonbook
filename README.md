### Study notes for: Compilers: Principles, Technique & Tools

Hi, here are my study notes and answers to some of the exercises for the book: Compilers: Principles, Techniques & Tools. This book is also known as the "Dragon Book". 

I don't cover everything in here, but most of the information here got me up to speed on how compilers are built. The solutions to some of the exercises try to be as comprehensive as possible to serve the purpose of tutorial.
